                    <h3>What is Noita?</h3>
                    <p>Noita is a 2D game in which every single pixel is physically simulated.  Often it seems that every pixel is also out to kill you.  Death in Noita is permanent.  When you die in Noita, you will start from the very beginning.  Death in Noita can happen slowly, or in most cases, instantly and unexpectedly.  The term for this form of death is “getting Noita’d”.</p>
                    <h3>How do I get Noita?</h3>
                    <p>Noita is only available on personal computers, but it is recommended that you use a desktop.  Most laptops and even some desktop computers aren’t suitable to run Noita.  You can get Noita using <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/881100/Noita/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/noita">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://nollagames.itch.io/noita">itch.io</a> or <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/noita">GOG</a>.</p>
                    <h3>Starting Noita</h3>
                    <p>Once you have installed Noita, start the game by double clicking it in your files.  After the game loads, you will be presented with a starting menu.  If the game window does not cover the full screen, I recommend going into the options menu and setting the window to fullscreen.  To start playing the game, click on “new game”. You will be presented with a cutscene.  Afterwards you can start playing.</p>
                    <h3>The controls</h3>
                    <p>To the left and right of you, there will be two rocks telling you how to move and shoot.  Entering the cave on your right will reveal more of the controls.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <p>The controls are as follows:</p>
                        <li>W, A, and D to move around</li>
                        <li>S to eat/drink</li>
                        <li>Left mouse button to shoot</li>
                        <li>F to kick</li>
                        <li>Number keys or your mouse scroll wheel to switch items</li>
                        <li>I to open your inventory</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="figs">

                    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                    <h3>Holy mountains</h3>
                    <p>The world of Noita is a maze descending deeper underground.  You will encounter many strange enemies, most of which can and will try to kill you.  On your way to the end, you must go through seven different levels, each with increasing difficulty.  Between each of these levels are “holy mountains”.  Holy mountains are safe zones where you can do the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Refill your health</li>
                        <li>Refill limited use spells</li>
                        <li>Buy new spells or wands</li>
                        <li>Edit your wands</li>
                        <li>Get a perk</li>
                        <li>Wand building</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Wand building</h3>
                    <p>Noita has a unique feature where you can edit and customize your weapons.  Wands can be modified using spells.  Noita has a wide variety of spells.  The following table describes the different types of spells:</p>
                    <table>
                        <tr>

                            <td>Torch:  produces fire at the tip of your wand.</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Utility</td>

                            <td>Long-distance cast:  casts a spell a short distance away.</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Projectile modifier</td>
                            <td>Changes the properties of most projectile or static projectile spells.</td>
                            <td>Freeze charge:  makes a spell freeze materials within a radius and freezes any enemies it hits.</td>
                        </tr>

                        </tr>
                    </table>
                    <p>Each spell has attributes which modify the wand properties until the next spell is cast. Wands also have unique properties.  For more information on wands here is a guide on <a href="https://noita.fandom.com/wiki/Wands">wand mechanics</a>.</p>

                    <h3>Perks</h3>
                    <p>Each holy mountain will have a perk altar.  Perk altars will display three different perks to aid you on your descent.  You will only get one per holy mountain.  Be careful when choosing your perk as some perks may make the game harder to survive.  You can reroll the perks at a starting price of 200 gold, which will be doubled after each reroll.  For a list of perks go <a href="https://noita.fandom.com/wiki/Perks">here</a>.</p>

                    <h2>Strategy</h2>
                    <p>The following will help you survive on your way to the end of Noita:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Be very careful</h3>
                            <p>In Noita, your health is your most valuable resource.  Bravely running head first into battle will almost always take away some if not all of your precious health.  The 100 starting health may seem like a lot, but it will run out very quickly, even quicker if you aren’t careful.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Use common sense</h3>
                            <p>Hovering the cursor over any pixel will reveal what material it is.  Whenever you find a new material, think about what you would do in real life.  In other words, try not to jump into a puddle of toxic sludge or stand in some fire.  Also, try not to shoot boxes and barrels that are close to you as they will explode.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Don’t cast new wands!</h3>
                            <p>Throughout your run, you will encounter wands which will have random spells on them.  Finding a wand and immediately using it can and likely will end your run.  Make sure to thoroughly check any new wand at least twice before you even think about using it.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Water</h3>
                            <p>Make sure to always carry a flask of water.  You will always start with a flask in your inventory.  This flask will usually contain water, but will occasionally contain other materials.  If it isn’t water, swamp, or brine, you should empty the flask and fill it with water.  Water can be used to put yourself out if you are on fire.  Covering yourself with water will cause you to gain the wet status effect.  While you are wet, you can not be set on fire.  Water can  wash off less desirable stains such as slime which slows you down.  Spraying water into a pool of toxic sludge will convert it into water.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Exploration</h3>
                            <p>Each level will have another area on at least one side.  While this area will be more dangerous, if you have most of your health left, you may wish to explore this area.  These areas will contain better wands and more items than the normal level.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Be immune</h3>
                            <p>One of the most beneficial types of perk are immunities.  Immunities will prevent all damage of a specific type.  The less damage types that affect you, the easier it is to survive the hostile environment that Noita provides.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Lava is not fire</h3>
                            <p>After getting fire immunity, you may be tempted to bathe in lava.  However, fire immunity will not protect you from lava.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Trick money</h3>
                            <p>Having lots of in game money is very important to beat the game.  Enemies will drop twice as much  money if their death was “accidental”.  Accidental kills, also known as trick kills, can be caused by the following:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Hitting an enemy with a physics object</li>
                                <li>Death by materials such as fire or acid</li>
                                <li>Indirect explosions such as from explosive barrels or unstable crystals</li>
                                <li>Electricity</li>
                                <li>Drowning</li>
                                <li>Certain projectiles such as summon rock spirit</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Respect holy mountains</h3>
                            <p>When holy mountains get sufficiently damaged by anything, that holy mountain and any afterwards will spawn Stevari (Steve for short).  Steve is almost boss-like and really annoying if you aren’t prepared.  Be careful not to summon Steve.  If Steve is summoned, be prepared to either slowly kill him while constantly dodging, run past him, or die.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Don’t be discouraged</h3>
                            <p>Noita is a very hard game.  It is almost impossible to beat the game in your first week of playing.  Beating Noita requires experience that can only be obtained by playing the game.  Having the right strategy will only help you learn.  Learning from your mistakes or your successes is the only way to progress.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>Strategy is required to beat Noita.  This is only a guide to help you develop your own strategy.  After you get the normal ending, you can pursue secrets.  Most of the content in Noita is hard to find without looking it up.
