                    <h3>About me</h3>
                    <p>	My name is Xander Burnett.  I don’t do much except code, play video games, and chip away at the seemingly endless mountain of homework I have.  I live with both of my loving parents, my younger sister Mackenzie, my fish Lenny, and my two cats Twix and Tex.  I have many plants, around 28 in total, all of which I try my best to keep alive.  I have taught myself crochet, which I occasionally use to make little woolen balls.  I’ve made so many balls that I have lost count.  I also like tying knots, I even have my own pet knot.  I enjoy watching and identifying birds, however, recently there haven’t been many around my house.</p>
                    <h3>Why I joined PTEC</h3>
                    <p>I decided to apply for PTEC in grade 8 for a couple of reasons.  The first reason was that I wanted to learn how to make games.  My interest in making games began when I was introduced to Scratch in school.  Scratch is basically like coding but for beginners.  After Scratch, I spent most of my free time trying to make games with it, but Scratch had its limits which is why I decided that I wanted to try learning real coding.  The other reason I applied for PTEC was that both of my two friends had also applied so I wanted to do the same.  Unfortunately, neither of them are still in PTEC now.</p>
                    <h3>I want to make a game</h3>
                    <p>By the end of PTEC, I hope to make a game.  I have tried many times to make a full game and failed all those times.  This is for a few reasons.  One reason is because I constantly come up with many more interesting ideas that I want to make into games more than whatever idea I am currently working on which is a problem because if I can’t stick to just one idea then I will never finish a game.  Another reason I haven’t made a full game is because I often run into problems that I can’t figure out.  Oftentimes with code a single character out of place can break everything.  Sometimes the error is obvious, however, my computer is very bad at telling me what is wrong.  In other words, I spend days to weeks on problem solving when I have one comma instead of a period, or other things like that.  Sometimes these kinds of things frustrate me enough that I decide to try making something else, which basically means that I never come back to that idea ever again.  All in all these reasons have prevented me from completing a game without fail for the last two years.  That is why when I complete my fourth and final year in PTEC I want to finally make a game.</p>
